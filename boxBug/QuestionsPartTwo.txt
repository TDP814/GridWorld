Questions for Part 2:
Set 2

1.What is the role of the instance variable sideLength?
	The role of sideLength to define the side length of the box that is being created by the flowers.
2.What is the role of th instnace variable steps?
	Steps are to keep track of the steps taken to complete one side of the box.
3.Why is the turn method called twice when steps become equal to sideLength?
	The turn method only goes 45degrees and not 90degrees to make a complete turn so it calls it twice to turn when the side is complete.
4.Why can the move method be called in the BoxBug class when there is no move mehtod in the BoxBug code?
	The move method is extended to the BoxBug code.
5.After a BoxBug is constructed, will the size of its square pattern always be the same? Why or why not?
	No because the size of the square pattern is found in the BoxBugRunner so once BoxBug is complete the square size is used in BoxBug to make the square.
6.Can the path a BoxBug travels ever change? Why or why not?
	Yes it can change with a wall in the way of a rock that would cause the bug to turn and reset the box.
7.When will the value of the steps be zero?
	The values of the steps will be zero at the start of ever corner.
